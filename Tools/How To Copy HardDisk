DO NOT RUN ANY COMMAND BEFORE READING ALL INSTRUCTIONS

To check your wirking hard disk's path, run

"sudo lsblk"

You should get something like this;

NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 238,5G  0 disk 
├─sda2   8:2    0   237G  0 part /
├─sda3   8:3    0   977M  0 part [SWAP]
└─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot/efi


In this output, "sda" is your hard disk path, note down this path. "sda1", "sda2" etc.. are partitions in your hard disk.

To start copy process, connect a new hard disk via usb.
New hard disk should have equal or larger volume than working hard disk. 

run "sudo lsblk" command again and note down your new hard disk's path

Now, we know which hard disk is our working copy and which hard disk is our new hard disk.

sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=150M

"if=/dev/sda" is input file parameter
"of=/dev/sdb" is output file parameter
"bs=150M" is block size parameter

"if" is abbrevation of input file, "of" is abbrevation of output file.

The working hard disk should be in input file field, otherwise working hard disk will be destroyed.
Before proceed, check hard disk paths in "if" and "of" field few times. When you feel safe, CHECK AGAIN!

check the new hard disk's writing speed by 

sudo hdparm -tT /dev/sdb

block size parameter should be half of the writing speed of new hard disk.

For the 250 GB SSD disks, this process should take 15 minutes.

Remove new hard disk and plug it in another computer. OS should start without any problem.

If there is any problem, it is related with boot. 

Try to follow below instructions;

step #1
turn off secure boot in your BIOS, to fix "kernel module load" errors.
boot to the GRUB menu
choose Advanced Options
choose Recovery mode
choose dpkg - fix broken packages
let it try to finish the aborted upgrade
If that doesn't resolve your problem, I'll give you a different set of specific commands to execute. Report back.

step #2 (detail pending)
sudo apt-get update

dpkg --configure -a

apt-get install -f
